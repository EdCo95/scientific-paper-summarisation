    From here we can create batches from the corpus and feed it into a model.

    In case `expand==False` each top-level entry of `xs` to be transformed
    replaces the original entry.
    `deep_map` supports `xs` to be a dictionary or a list/tuple:
      - In case `xs` is a dictionary, its transformed value is also a dictionary, and `keys` contains the keys of the
      values to be transformed.
      - In case `xs` is a list/tuple, `keys` contains the indices of the entries to be transformed
    The function `deep_map` is recursively applied to the values of `xs`,
    only at the deepest level, where the entries are no longer sequences/dicts, after which `fun` is applied.

    Args:
      `xs`: a sequence (list/tuple) of objects or sequences of objects.
      `fun`: a function to transform objects
      `keys`: seq with keys if `xs` is dict; seq with integer indices if `xs` is seq.
        For entries not in `keys`, the original `xs` value is retained.
      `fun_name`: default value 'trf'; string with function tag (e.g. 'lengths'),
        used if '''expand==True''' and '''isinstance(xs,dict)'''
        Say for example fun_name='lengths', and `keys` contains 'sentence', then the transformed dict would look like
        '''{'sentence':[sentences], 'sentence_lengths':[fun(sentences)] ...}'''
      `cache_fun`: should the function values for seen inputs be cached. Use with care, as it will affect functions with side effects.

    Returns:
      Transformed sequence or dictionary.
